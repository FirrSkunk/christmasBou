This is the source code for the christmas ornamant badge that was made for https://hawspets.org.  It is super simple, just a capaticive touch nose and three sets of lights that blink.  The brains of the badge is an Adafrunt Trinkrt M0, the same as the charity badge from Fur Squared eariler in 2020.  


## How to install

Just download the "main.py" file and copy it to the trinket over USB.  The trinket should reboot and you'll have blinky.  

## operation guide

boop the nose to make it blink for 4 seconds.  Double tap the nose twice in one second to make it stay on.  Tap the nose again to turn it off.
